We extended the ERC-721 token standard to include the game of pogs!

All interactions happen on-chain including a commit/reveal scheme for randomness.

Purchase a pack of pogs for basically the gas it cost to mint them and come play with the rest of the decentralized world.

## My Extra Notes

SlammerTime.sol and Cryptogs.sol are the core contracts. See the reference folder for commented out code (comments made in 2022 by our team). The OG project was created during an EthDenver hackathon, and this "reborn" Cryptogs project has been relaunched for EthDenver 2022!
