- 🧑‍🏭 \*Learn how signed messages can be used off-chain as a “sign in with Ethereum”: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples/tree/sign-in-with-web3

- 📡 Use that same signed message on-chain with ecrecover() or OpenZeppelin’s ECDSA lib to recover a signed message in Solidity: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol

--> as per Austin Griffith's ETH BUILD videos!

React is valuable to learn unless there is something better to work on... Solidity tutorials, or something else? Such as your own solidity project.

- React won't be a loss. There is no right answer. The advantage of doing more solidity is getting better and reaching jr dev phase.
- If you only know one language, and only in the context of itself you'll be vulnerable very quickly.
- In the scenario where you are focused on just one you can't easily just take on projects and tasks.
- React, NodeJS, Ethers, Hardhat, git are all things to make sure to continuously get better at.
  ---> NodeJS, Ethers, Hardhat.

Continue to focus on solidity, nodeJS, Ethers, Hardhat. React too to become more fullish-stack lol.

3 months of research, and 9 months of building subgraphs (typeScript) and reading a lot of solidity. Right attitude and ability to communicate is key of course. Creating content as well to stick out (technical blog and github repos)
