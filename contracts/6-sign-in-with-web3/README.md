- 🧑‍🏭 \*Learn how signed messages can be used off-chain as a “sign in with Ethereum”: https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples/tree/sign-in-with-web3

- 📡 Use that same signed message on-chain with ecrecover() or OpenZeppelin’s ECDSA lib to recover a signed message in Solidity: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol
