# Notes from Going Through this Challenge

### Links

### Approach

This challenge hasn't been finalized on eth-dev-speedrun just yet, so I did the following to ensure I understood it well enough:

1. Go through smart contracts and assess each line of code to ensure I understand it (the SVG side of things was the most challenging since I was new to it).
2. Write the code line by line referencing the medium post.
3. Come back to this after a couple of days and write it on your own without looking at the code.
4. Mark down other notes about this to keep in mind.

### Keep in Mind

1.  Make note on how price curves work --> really it's just about how to deal with math in solidity. It looks like it takes things as wei but if you add in ether it understands that. I'll have to practice and note how the best way to go about it is.
