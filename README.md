# 🏗 scaffold-eth | 🏰 BuidlGuidl

## 🚩 Purpose of this Repo

> 🙋🏻‍♂️ Smart Contracts for Scaffold-ETH will be stored within this open repo for future reference. Note that the contracts are stored here to show:

1. The final submission for that challenge.
2. Possible areas of study that I found noteable for the future.

The two aspects above are stored in respective sub-directories for each project. NOTE: Of course, these are just the raw smart contract files, so the necessary dependencies will be needed and whatnot. Consider these contracts just a reference, not an easily fork-able and deploy-able repo.

Each project is submitted through the telegram and other communications methods outlined by Austin Griffith, and contracts are deployed typically on Rinkeby. Rinkeby addresses are to be stored in the Details.md for each project.
